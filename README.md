## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a flight will be **delayed or not** at arrival.

A flight is considered **delayed** if the arrival delay is **greater than 15 minutes**.

## 📊 Dataset
The datasets come from the **U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)** and contain information about:
- flights
- airlines
- airports

### ⚠️ Important
Due to their large size, the CSV files are **not included in this GitHub repository**.

### Required files
Please place the following files locally in the `data/` directory:
- `flights.csv`
- `airlines.csv`
- `airports.csv`
